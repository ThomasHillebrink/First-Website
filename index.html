                    <p> Today I had a first preliminary talk about the second curriculum for this course, as it seems I will be finished with the first curriculum pretty soon. fortunately my initial aspiration to finish it this week might be a bit too optimistic, as it became clear there is still a lot of depth work to be done before I reach the end. But I will be reaching as far as I can.</p>
                            
                    <p> We had a chat about our Full Stack Adventure game and hammered out more of the details and decision of tasks, then I continued my lessons on advanced CSS.</p>

                        For today I have continued my lessons on Udacity about version control on management. Before I started those lessons I already familiarized myself with GitHub, so many of the concepts were already familiar to me at that point, though it was of course very interesting to learn about the source and basics of version control and see as to why GitHub was created and with task it is supposed to fill. I followed the instructions and played around with GitBash as well, but it was pretty clear that many of the techniques outlined in the lessons when it comes to spotting differences and changes in written code has mainly been automated by GitHub and Visual Studio Code itself. Regardless it was still interesting to read about.</p>
                            
                        <p>Next I started the lessons on visual web design. Due past experience with art and design as the child of an artist and being an hobby painter myself these concepts came very natural to me, and I was able to go through the lesson in less than an hour. The resources it presented are very valuable to have however.</p>
                            
                        <p>Now that I have the basics of web development learned and my own webpage has been uploaded and brought online through GitHub, I have now started the advanced HTML&CSS lessons on “learn.shahowe.”</p>
                        
                        <p>Looking at my current learning tempo, I aspire to finish the first curriculum on web development before the end of the week. Then, after I have returned from my short trip to my home country, I will be able to start with the second part.</p>

                    <p> After starting the day off with a quick meeting on our educational game for the game jam, I continued on the last leg of my HTML and CSS lessons, which I then finished well on schedule.

                    Then I moved on to setting up my GitHub account and uploaded my blog in it, which I have done since. I am currently going through the lessons on version control taught by Udacity, and will continue with that next week.</p>

                    <p> Today day went very different from what I expected, as I agreed to participate in a game jam. Initially when I joined I expected we would be building and coding our game from the ground up, and only later came to understand we would be building it on an excising platform. Which on one hand saves us a lot of time, but also significantly limits us in terms of what we can do with the game, as the platform seems to have been made for the purpose of creating simple geo-games, where players must physically to a location in the work in order to play. However, we shall do our best to create something nice.</p>

                    <p> Not much to report from today, I continued the HTML/CSS lessons from I love coding and are nearly finished. I coded and finished my personal blog as required in the exercises, something I am pretty proud of. It is very satisfying creating something that practical and visually pleasing after only a few days of doing this.
                    
                    <p> Today I will continue my HTML lessons and hopefully finish those. Then I will get started on getting familiar with Github.</p>

                    <p>  Today I have continued going over the basics of HTML and CSS further. Even though this is the second time I am learning this, I found that all the material made a lot more sense to me when reading it a second time around. The lessons asked me to code my own simple webpage as a manner of practise, which I did, and I thoroughly enjoyed doing. I’m looking forward to improving my CSS skills so I can make it look more professional.</p>
                    
                    <p> In the afternoon after lunch we headed to Käpylän Ammattikoulu to do some extra curricular activities. This time I opted for playing board games, as I know I will certainly enjoy it, and it seemed a popular choice among my peers. I will try to bring my sports clothing so I can try to partake in a sports event next time.</p>

                    <p> Today I started at Digitalents for my first day. Naturally, I started the day with a mixture of nerves and excitement so common when starting a new adventure. Further increased with the knowledge that the two familiar faces I knew would not be present in the morning I would start. </p> 
                    
                    <p> Upon arriving on the location I met Elli, who then guided me to the central hall where we would be having breakfast. Afterwards I attended a short presentation giving by Krishna which I didn’t fully understand, but the gist of it was clear to me. After a short introductory round I spoke with Krishna for a while to determine my study path. We determined my aspirations, motivations and challenges, and after a quick lunch break I got the work on the first assignments I was given.</p>
                    
                    <p> The Canva assignment asked me to make a photo collage summarizing of why I came here, and why I want to continue. After giving a good thought, boiling it down to the essence of why I do what I do, I decided that I could accurately summarize it to the word: Love. Love for another person is what brought me here. Love for where I ended up is why I stayed. And Love for myself is why I keep on going.</p>
                    
                    <p> With Finishing the Canva assignment, I moved on to going over the basics of HTML and CSS again, this time on ILoveCoding. My first impressions on the method are very positive. The videos are well structured, and give enough space and opportunity to play around independently, while also giving examples of different resources and programs available. Today I got to lesson 17 out of 71, and I aspire to finish this course before the end of the week.</p>
